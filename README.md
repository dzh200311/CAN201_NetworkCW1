This project presents a client-server architecture leveraging the TCP protocol to enable secure and efficient file exchange. The client application provides users with the ability to log in and obtain an access token for server interactions. Users can upload files from their local system, with the client segmenting files into discrete blocks for transmission. The server undertakes a rigorous validation process, ensuring the integrity of the whole file and subsequently generating a unique key and MD5 hash for the uploaded file upon successful upload completion. The client application features a user-friendly progress bar, offering real address issues, such as login failures, upload errors, or file integrity checks. This project is a testament to a reliable, and efficient means of interacting with server resources for seamless file sharing while upholding data integrity.
